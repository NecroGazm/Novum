# Novum
Created with my team in 2019 during my time at FullSail as our final project. This game is still a work in progress.
Novum was created originally titled as Spacer project during the Capstone project at the end of my degree program at Fullsail.
Each team was meant to have 4-7 members but our team only had 3. Myself ( Elizabeth Cherry), Mace Jimino, and Michael Fowler. 
This game has flaws and missing assets but I am in the progress of completing this game.
